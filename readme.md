EZTable
=======

EZTable is a lightweight python table library. It provides a class called Table  which is suitable for representing one-dimensional tables (e.g. time-sequences).

It is suitable for data analysis tasks. 

EZTable is built with an emphasis on simplicity, both in interface and internal design rather than performance or scalability. Toytable is intended to have as few dependancies as possible, and is therefore suitable for casual development tasks.

EZTable is not intended for high performance or scalability. Toytable is not complete. For these reasons, please consider evaluating other more mature packages (e.g. Pandas).
