EZTable: Lightweight python tables
==================================

.. image:: toy_table.png

EZTable is a lightweight python table library. It provides a class called Table which is suitable for representing
one-dimensional tables.

EZTable is built with an emphasis on simplicity, both in interface and internal design
rather than performance or scalability. EZTable is intended to have as few requirments
as possible, and is therefore suitable for casual development tasks or environments where
installation of compilers may be impossible.
