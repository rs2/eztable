EZTable
=======

EZTable is a lightweight python table library. It is designed to be as
easy as possible:

It's easy to install because it's pure python, you don't need to compile
any C extensions, however if you do have a compiler then a few of the
components can be made to work faster.

It's easy to deploy because it's packaged both sdist (.tar.gz format)
and also as a Python Wheel. You can use the Pip command to install it or
add it as a dependency of your project without introducing any extra
hassle.

It's easy to learn: There's plenty of documentation and examples of how
to use EZTable's main features.

It's easy to use, because the API is familiar to anybody who has used
lists and common Python sequences.
